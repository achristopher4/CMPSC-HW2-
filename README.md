Overall Problem

You are playing the game of Monopoly and you decide you wish to construct houses on one of your property groups.   The rules of the game require that the number of houses on the properties within each group may not differ by more than one.

You will be given an amount of money to spend, and the color Monopoly uses on the game board for a group of properties (see chart below).  The goal is to determine how many houses will go on each.  And to appear more conversational, the last line of output will use words to represent numbers instead of digits.

To make the program simple, you may assume that you will not have enough money to build past four houses per property (twelve total).   You do not need to convert the price of a house to a word (although that can be done rather simply).

Monopoly Property Groups

Here is a small table relating the colors of the monopoly property groups, the number of properties within the group, and the cost of the houses.

color	size	cost
purple	  2	  50
light blue	  3	  50
maroon	  3	100
orange	  3	100
red	  3	150
yellow	  3	150
green	  3	200
dark blue	  2	200
